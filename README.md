Low-Level Programming - Data Structures, Algorithms, Linux/Unix System Programming
This repository contains programs written for the low-level programming and algorithm track at ALX software engineering. In these projects, which occurred throughout the duration of the Year 1 curriculum, I learned about data structures, algorithms, and other low-level programming concepts while working in the C language. The specific list of projects contained follows:

0x00. C - Hello, World
0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while
0x02. C - Functions, nested loops
0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops
0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings
0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings
0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings
0x08. C - Recursion
0x09. C - Static libraries
